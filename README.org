* Typesafe SLI/SLO/Error budget description language

Compile your SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets along side your application code in source
control such that you can generate the monitoring configuration for your preferred
management backend (e.g. Terraform) and produce various documentation artifacts for
non-engineers to understand the current state of affairs.

** Status

This is merely a germ of an idea that I had 2020-Feb-01.

** Outline

Possibilities:
- use Purescript with the Go backend
- target Terraform's many monitoring providers as the /reference/ implementation and allow for other backends to extend funtionality
- leverage datatype generic programming methods to build a type-level "language"

** Goals

Provide a different example to HTTP APIs for datatype generic programming methods and scratch an /ops/ itch I currently have at the same time.
